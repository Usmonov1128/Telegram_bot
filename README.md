This Telegram bot is primarily designed for playing a game. In this game, the bot "thinks" of a random number, and the player's goal is to guess that number. The algorithm is set up as follows:

1. **The bot thinks of a number**: Initially, the bot randomly selects an integer within a specific range (e.g., between 1 and 100). This number is unknown to the player.

2. **The player makes a guess**: The bot prompts the player to guess the number by sending a message with their guessed number.

3. **The bot responds**: Each time a guess is received, the bot provides feedback:
   - If the guessed number is **lower** than the target number, the bot responds with "Higher" or "Try a larger number."
   - If the guessed number is **higher** than the target number, the bot responds with "Lower" or "Try a smaller number."
   - If the player correctly guesses the number, the bot responds with "You guessed it!" and the game ends.

4. **Restarting the game**: After the player guesses the number, the bot may offer to start a new game or end the session.

This bot is built using Node.js.
